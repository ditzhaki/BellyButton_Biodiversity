# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview

Many bacterial species are not well studied and many more remain unknown to science. Roza, a biological researcher in a prominent microbiology laboratory, is tasked with discovering and documenting these bacteria. In particular, Roza is interested in bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Her lab has partnered with Improbable Beef, a food startup, to research candidate species. Roza has a hypothesis that there is a micro-organism that can supply the next best tastes and she believes it can be found from bacteria found on the human body, specifically in the belly button. To test her hypothesis, Roza has sampled the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons. Each person's identity is anonymous and have instead been assigned an ID number.

We have created a dashboard that both research participants and fellow researchers can access that displays which bacterial species live in each participants navels. The dashboard shows the Bacteria cultures found per sample, the top 10 bacteria cultures found in a participant, and displays how often the participant washed their belly button per week. The project page has been deployed and can be viewed [here](https://ditzhaki.github.io/BellyButton_Biodiversity/).
